# Node CPP Merge Reference

TODO: This is a working reference for creating a Node C++ plugin. There are several data types, and examples for how to 
handle data passing between javascript and C++. This example is focused towards creating a 'merge' method
that would take a multidemensional javascript, pass it to the C++ plugin, have a merge action performed, and then have a new multidimensional 
array returned.
Great activity to get a better understanding of V8 classes and great opportunity to use two different languages on 
one project
## Installation

TODO: git fetch origin 

## Usage

TODO: 

1. Install node-gyp globally to compile 

2. Run 'node-gyp configure build' within cpp folder

3. Run 'make' to compile cpp changes and test using 'merge_test.cc' file

## History

TODO: Came from attempt to find faster way to merge large language files for clients, just a learning exercise at the moment
